Privacy & Trust : Domain Authority
A Domain Authority is an issuer of user accounts and pseudonyms.
It is responsible for user authentication and identifier-based
discovery. When a user requests an account, a domain authority
is responsible for verifying user data for further assertion issuing.
This verification can follow offline methods. Furthermore, it federates
openly with other domain authorities, managing trust in a distributed way.
In terms of interoperability, it may be able to federate with servers
of other federated social networks or social networking sites.
